        It has been such a long time since we met each other in person. I miss everything about being together in person with you. To keep myself happy about all this I lie to myself that at least I am on call with her the entire day. I tell that to myself, forcing me to think that if I was in Bangladesh I wouldn’t be able to do all this everyday but the truth is I would’t have to do all this in Bangladesh. I would be able to meet you in person. Even if it was once a week. Your touch is what I crave now. I love youuu. Waaahdnewhdiens
